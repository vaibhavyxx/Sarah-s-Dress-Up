            <p>I chose this theme as growing up, I loved playing Barbie games. However, I hated
                those games where I could drag and drop the outfits. Hence, in this game I want to
                give user as much freedom as possible to dress up their characters.
            </p>
            <p><a href="https://www.numuki.com/game/barbie-make-a-mag/">Refer this as to how the controls users have in this game</a>
            <br>I want to have something similar to that.</p>
